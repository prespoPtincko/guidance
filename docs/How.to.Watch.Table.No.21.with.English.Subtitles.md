If you are curious about the plot of Table No. 21, here is a brief summary. Spoilers ahead!
 
The film begins with Vivaan (Rajeev Khandelwal) and Siya (Tena Desae), a married couple who are struggling financially and emotionally. They win a trip to Fiji in a lucky draw and decide to celebrate their anniversary there. On their arrival, they are greeted by Mr. Khan (Paresh Rawal), a mysterious and wealthy man who invites them to play a game called Table No. 21.
 
The game consists of 21 questions that Vivaan and Siya have to answer truthfully while facing a camera. For each correct answer, they will receive 10 million rupees. However, if they lie or refuse to answer, they will face a severe punishment. They also have to sign a contract that states that they cannot quit the game or contact anyone outside.
 
As the game progresses, the questions and tasks become more personal and disturbing, revealing dark secrets and traumas from their pasts. Vivaan and Siya realize that they are trapped in a deadly game that is connected to their college days, where they were involved in a ragging incident that led to the death of a fellow student named Akram (Dhruv Ganesh).
 
Mr. Khan turns out to be Akram's father, who has orchestrated the game as a revenge for his son's death. He reveals that he has kidnapped Vivaan and Siya's friends who were also part of the ragging and has killed them one by one. He also tells them that the money they have won is actually their own, which he has hacked from their bank accounts.
 
The final question is whether Vivaan and Siya love each other. They both answer yes, but Mr. Khan shows them a video of Vivaan cheating on Siya with their neighbor Neeti (Hanif Hilal). Siya is heartbroken and shoots Vivaan with a gun provided by Mr. Khan. She then shoots herself, leaving Mr. Khan as the sole survivor of the game.
 
The film ends with a message that ragging is a crime and should be stopped.
