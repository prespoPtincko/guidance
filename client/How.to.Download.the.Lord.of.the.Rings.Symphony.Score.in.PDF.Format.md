Here are some additional information about the symphony and its composer:
 
Johan de Meij (born 1953) is a Dutch composer, conductor, trombonist, and tubist. He studied trombone and conducting at the Royal Conservatory of Music in The Hague. He has written many works for wind orchestra, brass band, fanfare band, orchestra, choir, and chamber music. He is also known for his arrangements of film music and musicals.
 
The Lord of the Rings Symphony No. 1 was his first composition for wind orchestra and his breakthrough work. He started working on it in 1984 and finished it in 1987. He was inspired by the book by Tolkien, which he had read several times since his childhood. He did not use any existing themes from the movies or other adaptations of the story, but created his own musical language to depict the characters and events.
 
The symphony has been performed by many renowned wind orchestras and conductors around the world, such as the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra, the Royal Military Band of the Netherlands, the Dallas Wind Symphony, and the London Symphony Orchestra. It has also been recorded several times by different labels. In 2001, de Meij made a new version of the symphony for symphony orchestra and choir, which was premiered by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra.
 
The Lord of the Rings Symphony No. 1 is a masterpiece of wind band literature and a tribute to the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a challenging but rewarding work for both performers and listeners, who can immerse themselves in the magical world of Middle-earth through music.
